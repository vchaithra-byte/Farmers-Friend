        <h2><a name="climate"></a> Climatic Requirements</h2>
        <p>Tomato is a warm season crop, it requires warm and
        cool climate. The plants cannot withstand frost and high humidity. Also
        light intensity affects pigmentation, fruit colour, fruit set. The plant
        is highly affected by adverse climatic conditions. It requires different
        climatic range for seed germination, seedling growth, flower and fruit
        set, and fruit quality. Temperature below 10<sup>0</sup>C and above 38<sup>0</sup>C
        adversely affects plant tissues thereby slow down physiological
        activities. It thrives well in temperature 10<sup>0</sup>C to 30<sup>0</sup>C
        with optimum range of temperature is 21-24<sup>0</sup>C. The mean
        temperature below 16<sup>0</sup>C and above 27<sup>0</sup>C are not
        desirable. The plant doesnâ€™t withstand frost, it requires low to
        medium rainfall, and does well under average monthly temperature of 21
        to 23<sup>0</sup>C. Avoid water stress and long dry period as it causes
        cracking of fruits. Bright sunshine at the time of fruit set helps to
        develop dark red coloured fruits.</p>

        <h2><a name="Soil Requirement"></a>Soil Requirement</h2>        
        <p>Tomatoes do very well on most mineral soils, but they
        prefer deep, well drained sandy loams. Upper layer of soil should be
        porous with little sand and good clay in the subsoil. Soil depth 15 to
        20cm proves to be good for healthy crop. Deep tillage can allow for
        adequate root penetration in heavy clay type soils, which allows for
        production in these soil types.<br /><br />Tomato is a moderately tolerant crop to a wide pH
        range. A pH of 5.5- 6.8 is preferred. Though tomato plants will do well
        in more acidic soils with adequate nutrient supply and availability.
        Tomato is moderately tolerant to acid an soil that is pH of 5.5. The
        soils with proper water holding capacity, aeration, free from salts are
        selected for cultivation.<br /><br />Soils extremely high in organic matter are not
        recommended due to the high moisture content of this media and nutrient
        deficiencies. But, as always, the addition of organic matter to mineral
        soils will increase yield.</p></div>
        <div class="row space-clear">
        <h2><a name="Choice"></a>Choice of seeds</h2>
        <p>After seed production, diseased, broken seeds are
        discarded. The seeds for sowing should be free from inert matter. Early
        germinating, bold, uniform in shape and size, seeds are selected for
        sowing. Hybrid seeds from F1 generation are advantageous for sowing as
        it gives early and high yield uniform fruity, resistant to adverse
        environmental conditions.</font></p>
        <strong>a) Seed and sowing</strong>
        <p>Tomato is generally cultivated by transplanting
        seedlings on ridges and furrows. At the time of transplanting seedlings
        are harder by exposing to open weather or by withholding irrigation. A
        seed rate of 400 to 500g/ha is required.</p>
        <p>Seeds are treated with Thiram @ 3g/kg of seed to
        protect from seed born diseases. Seed treatment with B. naphthoxyacetic
        acid (BNOA) at 25 and 50 ppm, gibberllic acid (GA3) at 5-20 ppm and
        chlorophenoxy acetic at 10 and 20 ppm was found to improve the growth
        and yield of tomato.</p>
        <p>Seeds are sown in June July for autumn winter crop
        and for spring summer crop seeds are sown in November. In the hills seed
        is sown in March April. The spacing recommended for the autumn winter
        crop is 75 x 60cm and for spring summer crop 75 x 45cm.</p></div>

                   <p>The ideal seedbed should be 60cm wide, 5-6cm long and
        20-25cm high. Clods and stubbles should be removed from the seedbed. Add
        sieved FYM and fine sand on the seedbed. Bring them to fine tilth.
        Drench the bed with Fytolon/Dithane M-45 @ 2-2.5 g/lit of water. Draw
        the lines 10 to 15cm apart throughout the length of the seedbed. Sow the
        seeds thinly spaced in lines, press gently, cover with fine sand and
        then cover the bed with straw. Irrigate with rose can. Irrigate the
        seedbed twice a day till the seeds germinate. Remove the straw after the
        seeds germinate. Apply a little Thimet at 4-5 leaf stage. Spray the
        seedlings with Metasystox/Thiodan @ 2-2.5 ml/lit water and Dithane M-45
        @ 2-2.5 g/lit water.</p></div>

        <h2><a name="Fertilizers"></a>Fertilizers</h2>
        <p>As the fruit production and quality depends upon
        nutrient availability and fertilizer application so balance fertilizer
        are applied as per requirement. The nitrogen in adequate quantity
        increases fruit quality, fruit size, color and taste. It also helps in
        increasing desirable acidic flavor. Adequate amount of potassium is also
        required for growth, yield and quality. Mono Ammonium Phosphate (MAP)
        may be used as a starter fertilizer to supply adequate phosphorus during
        germination and seedling stages. Calcium availability is also very
        important to control soil pH and nutrient availability. Sandy soils will
        require a higher rate of fertilizer, and more frequent applications of
        these fertilizers due to increased leaching of essential nutrients. The
        seedlings are sprayed with starter solution of micronutrient. Before
        planting farm yard manure @ 50 ton per hectares should be incorporated.
        Normally tomato crop requires 120kg Nitrogen (N), 50kg Phosphorus (P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>),
        and 50kg Potash (K<sub>2</sub>O). Nitrogen should be given in split
        doses. Half nitrogen and full P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> is given at the
        time of transplanting and remaining nitrogen is given after 30 days and
        60 days of transplanting.</p>
        <p>Soil and tissue analyses should be taken throughout
        the growing and production season to insure essential nutrients are in
        their proper amounts and ratios. Tissue analysis of a nutritionally
        sufficient plant will show the following nutrient status:</p>

        <h2><a name="Irrigation"></a> Irrigation</h2>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
		</p>
        <p>Tomatoes have been observed to withdraw water from
        depths up to 13 feet in a well structured soil. Tomato plants require
        adequate moisture throughout their growth period. First irrigation is
        required soon after seedlings are transplanted. Frequent water is
        necessary in root zone when plants are small. In summer irrigation at
        intervals of 3-4 days and 10-15 days water is necessary to maintain wet
        soil. Erratic moisture conditions can cause radial and concentric
        cracking on fruit.</p></div>

        <h2><a name="Implements"></a>Implements for Interculturing Operations</h2>
        
        <p>Generally interculturing operations like hand hoeing,
        weeding, mulching, staking is followed in tomato. Implements like
        hand-hoe, khurpi, land leveller etc. are used.</p></div>
        <div class="row space-clear">
        <h2><a name="Inter"></a> Inter Culture Operations</h2>
        <p>Pre-emergence applications of herbicides like
        metribuzin at 0.35 kg/ha, fluchloralin 1.25 kg/ha has been found
        effective to increase the tomato yield significantly in comparison to
        traditional method of hand weeding. Also plastic mulching (black or
        transparent) can be used to control the weeds. Weeds can be controlled
        successfully by mulching plus use of herbicides (pendimethalin @ 0.75kg
        ai/ha or oxyflorophen @ 0.12kg ai/ha).</p>
        <p>Spraying of PCPA at 50 ppm, IAA at 50 ppm or borax 1%
        gave the fruit set in summer season. PCPA spray at flowering stage was
        observed to create favorable conditions for fruit set in low as well as
        high temperatures.</p></div>

        <h2><a name="Staking"></a> Staking of Tomato</h2>
        <p style="text-align:center">
        
        <p>Due to staking there is better growth of tomato plant
        and branches, increased fruit bearing, and improved quality of fruits.
        Cultural operations like fruit picking, spraying, weeding, fertilisers
        application and earthing up etc. for staking can be done by two methods.
        In first type, at each plant sticks of 1.5-2meter length and 2.5cm
        thickness are placed and plant of tomato is staked as it is growing. In
        second type, a network of wire and bamboo is form and with the help of
        sutali (small rope) branches of plant is spread. Secondary branches
        should be cut upto 30 cm and from 30 cm height keeping two main branches
        plant should be allow to spread on this network.&nbsp;</p></div>

      <ul>
        <li><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FF0000">Mature green fruit:</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#008000">- Fruits are bulk packed in ventilated containers
          for shipment. Those picked to be shipped are picked at the mature
          green stage and sprayed with ethylene 48 hours prior to shipping.
          Immature green tomatoes will ripen poorly and be of low quality.
          However, tomatoes harvested at the mature green stage will ripen into
          a product indiscernible from vine-ripened fruit. A simple way to
          determine maturity is to slice the tomato with a sharp knife. If seeds
          are cut, the fruit is too immature for harvest and will not ripen
          properly.</font></li>

        <li><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FF0000">Vine-ripened tomatoes</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#008000"> should be harvested at the breaker stage to
          ensure the best quality. Fruit at the breaker stage, which have some
          interlocular gel and a pinkish red color on the inside, are sure to be
          mature. Such fruit can be handled and shipped better than that which
          has more color, and it will often bring a higher price than less
          mature tomatoes. If tomatoes are to be vine-ripened, fields should be
          harvested often and thoroughly to narrow the range of ripeness.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FF0000">Fully ripe:</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#008000">- Processing tomatoes are picked fully ripe.</font></li>

      of the season. Remove all diseased, misshapen, and otherwise cull tomatoes

        <h2><a name="Transportation"></a>Means of Transportation</h2>
      <p>Tomatoes are highly perishable in nature hence quick
      means of transportation is necessary. Tomatoes are transported by road
      through tractors, trucks and also by rail and air to distant markets.
      Village produce is transported to the near by towns and city market only
      by road. The cargo services are also available for transportation.
      Processed tomatoes are having high export potential hence transported to
      different countries like USA, Saudi Arabia and Japan etc.</font></p>
