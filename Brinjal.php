<h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3> 
 <p>Brinjal or Eggplant is an important crop of sub tropics and tropics. The name brinjal is popular in Indian subcontinents and is derived from Arabic and Sanskrit whereas the name eggplant has been derived from the shape of the fruit of some varieties, which are white and
resemble in shape to chicken eggs. It is also called aubergine (French word) in Europe. The brinjal is of much importance in the warm areas of Far East, being grown extensively in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, China and the Philippines. It is also popular in Egypt, France, Italy and United States. In India, it is one of the most common, popular and principal vegetable crops
grown throughout the country except higher altitudes. It is a versatile crop adapted to different agro-climatic regions and can be grown throughout the year. It is a perennial but grown commercially as an annual crop. A number of cultivars are grown in India, consumer preference being dependent upon fruit colour, size and shape.

</ul>
</p>
   <h3 id="cli">Climatic Condition </h3>
   <p>The brinjal is a warm season crop, therefore susceptible to severe frost. Low temperature during the cool season causes deformation of vegetables. A long and warm growing season is desirable for successful brinjal farming. Cool nights and short summers are not suitable for satisfactory production. A daily average temperature of 13 to 21 C is most favourable for optimum growth and yield. The brinjal seed germinate well @25C</p>
   <h3 id="suit">Suitable Soil </h3>
   <p>The brinjal plants can be grown in all types of soil varying from light sandy to heavy clay. Well drained soil rich in organic matter with pH of 6.5- 7.5. Light soils are good for an early yield, while clay-loam and silt-loam are well suited for higher yield..
 </p>
 <h3 id="pro">Propagation of Soil For Brinjal Farming</h3>
<p>Since the crop remain in the field for a number of months. The soil should be thoroughly prepared by ploughing 4 to 5 times before transplanting the seedlings. Bulky organic manures like well rotten crowding or compost should be incorporated evenly on the soil. Thoroughly prepare the field with the addition of FYM @ 25 t / ha and form ridges and furrows at a spacing of 60 cm. Apply 2 kg / ha of Azospirillum and 2 kg / ha of Phosphobacteria by mixing with 50 kg of FYM. Irrigate the furrows and transplant 30-35 days old seedlings at 60 cm apart on the ridges.</p>

<p> Apply FYM 10 kg, neem cake 1 kg, VAM 50 g, enriched super phosphate 100 g and furadon 10 g per square metre before sowing. Area required for raising seedling for planting 1.0 ha is 100 sq.m.</p>

   <h3 id="rat1"> Seed Rate & Sowing Time</h3>
   <p> Varieties : 400 grams /ha ,Hybrids : 200 grams /ha.December – January and May – June.</p>
  <h3 id="sow"> Seed treatment in Brinjal Farming  </h3>
  <p> Treat the brinjal seeds with Trichoderma viride @ 4 g / kg or Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 10 g / kg of seed. Treat the seeds with Azospirillum @ 40 g / 400 g of seeds using rice gruel as adhesive. Irrigate with rose can. In raised nursery beds, sow the seeds in lines at 10 cm apart and cover with sand. Transplant the seedlings 30 – 35 days after sowing at 60 cm apart in the ridges.</p>
   <h3 id="irr">Transplanting in Brinjal Farming  </h3>
   <p> The seedlings are ready in 4-5 weeks for transplanting, when they attained a height of 12-15 cm with 3-to 4leavess. Harden the seedlings by withholding irrigation. Uproot the seedlings carefully without injury to the roots. Transplanting should b e done during evening hours followed by irrigation. Firmly press the soil around the seedlings. Spacing depends upon the fertility status of soil, type of verities and suitability of the season. In general 60×60 cm spacing is kept for non-spreading type
verities and 75-90×60-75 cm for spreading type verities

   <h3 id="irr">Irrigation/Water supply </h3>
   <p>Water the field as per the need of crop. Timely irrigation is quite essential for good growth, flowering, fruit setting and development of fruits. Higher yield may be obtained at optimum moisture level and soil fertility conditions. In plains irrigation should be applied every third to fourth day during hot weather and every 7 to12 days during winter. Irrigation is given before top dressing of there is no rain. The brinjal field should be regularly irrigated to keep the soil moist during frosty days.</p>

    <h3 id="fer">Inter-Culture and Weed Control in Brinjal Farming  </h3>
    <p> The weeds should be controlled as soon as they seen, either by traditional method of hand weeding and hoeing or by application of herbicides. Regular or frequent shallow cultivation should be done at regular intervals so as to keep the field free from weeds and to facilitate soil aeration and proper root development.
The most serious weed in brinjal is the Orabanchae sp. It is root parasite and it should be controlled carefully .Gap filling should be done wherever needed during evening hours followed by irrigation .Pre- plant soil incorporation of Fluchloralin (1- 1.5 kg/ha) or Oxadiazon  (0.5 kg/ha) and pre-planting surface spraying of Alachlor (1-1.5 kg/ha) control the weeds of brinjal successfully.
</p>
   <h3 id="fer">Application of manures and fertilizers </h3>
   <p>Apply 2 kg each of Azospirillum and Phosphobacteria in the main field at planting.<br\>
<b>Varieties :-</b> Basal dose : FYM 25 t/ha, NPK 50:50:30 kg/ ha. Top dressing : 50 kg N/ha on 30th day of planting or during earthing up.
<br\>
<b>Hybrids :- </b>Basal dose : FYM 25 t/ha, NPK 100:150:100 kg/ha. Top dressing : 100 kg N/ha on 30th day of planting or during earthing up.

   <h3 id="har">Harvesting and Yield</h3>
   <p>The brinjal fruits are harvested when they attain full size and colour but before start of ripening. Tenderness bright colour and glossy appearance of fruit is the optimum stage of harvesting of fruits. When the vegetables look dull, it is an indication of maturity and loss of quality in brinjal farming.</p>
