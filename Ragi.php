<h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
 <p>  		
Finger millet is important small millet grown in India. It is a staple food in many hilly regions of the country. It is grown both for grain and forage. Grains are rich in minerals and are the richest source of calcium used in many preparations like cakes, puddings, sweet etc. it is also a rich source of iron, protein, fiber and other minerals and is a gluten (elastic texture) free food. It has low fat content and contains mainly unsaturated fat. Due to rich fiber content finger millet is believed to be a good laxative and prevents constipation. It is a good food for people who suffering from diabetes, liver diseases, high blood pressure, heart weakness and asthma. Its green straw is suitable for making silage. The major finger millet growing states are Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat.</p>
 <h3 id="cul">Climate </h3>
 <p>
Finger millet is a crop of tropical and subtropical climate and can be cultivated up to an altitude of 2100 m. It is heat loving plant and for its germination, the minimum temperature required is 8-10°C. A mean temperature range of 26-29°C is the best for proper development and good crop yield. </p>
 <h3 id="Soil">Soil</h3>
 <p>
 Finger millet can be grown on a wide adaptability to different soil from very poor to very fertile and can tolerate a certain degree of alkalinity. The best soil is alluvial, loamy and sandy soil with good drainage.
 </p>

 <h3 id="Season">Season</h3>
 <p>
Finger millet is grown in all the cropping seasons in different parts of the country. More than 90 per cent of the area is under rainfed conditions, grown during Kharif season.

  <h3 id="Tillage">Tillage  </h3>
 <p>
 Fall ploughing is advantageous for moisture conservation.In the month of April or May, one deep ploughing with mould board plough Followed by ploughing with wooden plough twice is necessary. Before sowing secondary tillage with cultivator and multiple tooth hoe to prepare smooth seed bed is necessary. 
<p><img src="http://agrigoaexpert.res.in/icar/category/agriculture/fieldcrops/millet/ragi/t1.jpg" width="200" height="200" style="margin-left: 200px;"/> <img src="http://agrigoaexpert.res.in/icar/category/agriculture/fieldcrops/millet/ragi/t2.jpg" width="200" height="200" style="margin-left: 50px;"/> 
</p>
<p>Minor land smoothening before sowing helps in better in-situ moisture conservation. Seeds are very small and take 5-7 days to germinate. Hence good seeds, land preparation helps in better germination, minimize weeds problem and effective soil moisture conservation.</p>
 </p><br/>
 <p>In Uttaranchal where frequent ploughing operations are difficult to carry out effective digging and turning of soil, removing perennial weeds, land smoothening, providing inward slope with a shallow drain helps in taking out excess rain water. </p></br>
 
 
  <h3 id="method">Seed rate</h3>
 <p>
A seed rate of 10 kg ha-1 is found to be optimum for drill sowing and 5 kg ha-1 for raising seedlings for transplanted condition.<p>
</p>
</p>
 </p>
    
	 <h3 id="Sowing">Sowing/Planting</h3>
 <p>
 Line sowing is beneficial helps in inter cultivation and control of weeds effectively. Maintenance of optimum plant population of 4-5 lakh plants ha-1 this is attained by line sowing using seed drill giving a spacing of 22.5-30 cm between rows and 7.5-10 cm between plants Transplanting in irrigated condition
 </p>
 
 <h3 id="Spacing">Spacing and Manuring</h3>
 <center><img src="http://agrigoaexpert.res.in/icar/category/agriculture/fieldcrops/millet/ragi/2.jpg" width="480" height="370" /> </center>
 <p> Entire P2O5 and K2O are to be applied at sowing, whereas nitrogen is to be applied in two or three split doses depending upon moisture availability. 
In areas of good rainfall and moisture availability:  50% of recommended nitrogen is to be applied at sowing and the remaining 50% in two equal splits at 25-30 and 40-45 days after sowing. 
In areas of uncertain rainfall: 50% at sowing and the remaining 50% around 35 days after sowing is recommended. 
Adequate application of FYM, 7.5 to 10 tonnes per hectare help in better development of root growth.

 </p>
 <h3 id="Bio-fertilizers">Bio-fertilizers</h3>
 <p>
Treating seeds with Azospirillumbrasilense(N fixing bacterium) and Aspergillusawamori(P Solubilizing fungus) @ 25 g/kg seed is beneficial. In case seeds are to be treated with seed dressing chemicals, treat the seeds first with seed dressing chemicals and then with bio-fertilizers at the time of sowing. </p>
<P>
 <B>Procedure for inoculating seeds with bio-fertilizers  </B></BR>
1.	Bio-fertilizer culture specific to the crop is to be used @ 25g per kg of seed.</BR>
2.	Sticker solution is necessary for effective seed inoculation. This can be prepared by dissolving 25 g jaggery or sugar in 250 ml water and boiling for 5 minutes. The   solution thus prepared is cooled.</BR>
3.	Smear the seeds well using the required quantity of sticker solution. Then add culture to the seeds and mix thoroughly so as to get a fine coating of culture on the seed.</BR>
4.	The culture-coated seed is to be dried well in shade to avoid clumping of seeds.</BR>
5.	 Use the inoculated seeds for sowing.</BR></BR>
</P>

 <h3 id="moisture">Soil and moisture conservation practices</h3>
 <p>
a)	Summer ploughing or ploughing after the harvest of previous crop</BR>
b)	Ploughing across the slope </BR>
c)	Errection of small section bunds at an interval of 10-12m depending up on the slope  </BR>
and levelling the depressions  </BR>
d)	Opening a dead furrow at 3.3 to 4.0 m interval.</BR> </BR>
 </p>
 
 <h3 id="Nursery">Nursery management</h3>
 <p>
An area of 150 m2 is required to raise seedlings to suffice 1 ha.35-38 beds of 4 feet wide and 25 feet long and 4 inches height fine seed bed is required. <BR/>
Apply 2-3 baskets of well decomposed FYM along with 1 kg super phosphate, half kg muriate of potash and half kg ammonium phosphate and 750 g zinc sulphate per bed. Sow the seeds by opening rows at every 3 inch uniformly. Cover the seed with well decomposed FYM and soil/sand/water every bed. Top dress with urea 500 g per bed when the seedlings are 12-14 days old.<BR/>
Seedlings of 21-25 days old are ideal for transplanting in rows of 22.5-25 cm with 2 seedlings /hill with 10 cm between hills.<BR/>
Treating seeds with Azospirullumbrasilense (nitrogen fixing bacterium) and Aspergillusawamouri (phosphate solubalizing fungus) @ 25 g kg-1 is beneficial.<BR/>

 <h3 id="Cropping">Cropping Systems: Inter cropping, crop rotation and cropping sequence</h3><br/>
 <u> Inter cropping</u><br/>
 <center><img src="http://agrigoaexpert.res.in/icar/category/agriculture/fieldcrops/millet/ragi/3.jpg" width="600" height="336" /> </center>
 <p>
<u>Crop Rotation</u><br/>
<b>Northern states: </b>Rotation with legumes like green gram/black gram/rice 
bean/soybean <br/>
<b>Southern states: </b> a. Horse gram, pigeon pea, field bean or ground nut 
			      b. This practice will minimize inorganic fertilizer application and also 
sustain higher yields. 
			      c. Finger millet-finger millet rotation must be discouraged as it affects 
sustainability of soil as well as crop yield.
</p>

<p><u>Cropping sequence</u></br>
<b>Northern Bihar:</b> Potato-paddy-finger millet cropping sequence is highly 
remunerative than other cropping sequences for garden land. <br/>

<b>Southern Karnataka or Deccan plateau: </b>Finger millet-potato-maize or finger 
millet-onion-finger millet are highly remunerative cropping 
sequences. <br/>
<b>Assured rainfall areas:</b> raising crop of cowpea or green gram or Sesamum
followed by sowing / transplanting of early duration finger 
millet can be practiced.
 </p>
 
<h3 id="Weed">Weed control</h3>
<p>
Weeds problem in ragi crop can be effectively managed by cultural and mechanical measures<br/>
<b>Line sowing:</b> 2-3 inter cultivations and one hand weeding <br/>
<b>Broadcast crop: </b>2 effective hand weeding will minimize weeds<br/>
<b>In assured rainfall and irrigated areas:</b> Pre-emergence spray: Isoproturon @ 0.5 kg a.i./ha. (Rainfed areas), Oxyflurofen @ 0.1 lta.i /ha (Irrigated areas)<br/>
<b>Post-emergent spray: </b>2, 4-D sodium salt @ 0.75 kg a.i./ha Spraying around 20-25 days after sowing effectively control weeds. <br/>
</p>


<h3 id="Irrigation">Irrigation</h3>
<p>
Depending on soil type, weather condition and duration of variety, 8-14 irrigations are necessary.<br/>
<b>Light soils:</b> Irrigate the crop once in 6-8 days <br/>
<b>Heavy soils: </b> once in 12-15 days.<br/>
</p>

 <h3 id="Harvesting">Harvesting  </h3>
 <p>
The crop matures in about 95 to 110dasy for early varieties and 115 to 125 days for medium to late duration varieties depending on the tract and the variety. The ear heads are harvested with ordinary sickles and straw is cut close to ground. At some places under rainfed condition, the whole plant with ear head is cut, heaped and then threshed<p>

</p>

 <h3 id="Yield">Yield  </h3>
 <p>
It is possible to harvest 25-30 qt/ha of grain and 60-70 qt/ha of fodder. The straw of finger millet makes nutritious fodder. It can be conserved by putting up in well-built stak.</p>
